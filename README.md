## Project Overview

Geldium, a digital lending and consumer credit provider, experienced an increase in credit card delinquency rates. This project applies **AI-powered data analysis** to:

- Identify customers at risk of missing payments
- Build a predictive modeling framework (Random Forest)
- Recommend targeted, fair intervention strategies
- Ensure Responsible AI principles throughout

##Key Findings

| Finding | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Dataset** | 500 customers, 19 features, 16% delinquency rate |
| **Strongest Predictor** | Missed_Payments + 6-month payment history |
| **Counter-intuitive** | Delinquent customers had *higher* avg income ($113K vs $107K) |
| **Data Issues** | Employment_Status inconsistencies + 4 Credit_Utilization outliers |
| **Class Imbalance** | 84% non-delinquent vs 16% delinquent |

## Model Approach

- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier
- **Why:** Balances accuracy + interpretability — critical for financial compliance
- **Top 5 Features:**
  1. Missed_Payments
  2. Month_1 to Month_6 (payment history)
  3. Debt_to_Income_Ratio
  4. Credit_Utilization
  5. Account_Tenure
- **Evaluation:** AUC-ROC > 0.75 | F1 Score > 0.70

## Responsible AI

- Disparate Impact Analysis across Age, Location, Employment segments
- Human review required for all high-risk decisions
- Plain-language explanations for customers
- GDPR & ECOA compliance considered
